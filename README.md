HiggsCombine datacards for SMP-24-011. Tested with Combinev10 and recommended CMSSW version CMSSW_14_1_0_pre4.

Datacards are created starting from DatacardTemplate.txt using the following command:

```
python3 createDatacards.py Datacard
```

They are also automatically combined to a global datacard, named Datacard_combined.txt
